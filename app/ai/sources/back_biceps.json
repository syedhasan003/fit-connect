    "claim": "A back and biceps bro split emphasizing vertical and horizontal pulling maximizes hypertrophy when volume is sufficient and sets are taken close to failure.",

    "evidence": "Back and biceps hypertrophy is optimized through compound pulling movements, varied angles, and proximity to muscular failure with adequate rest intervals.",
